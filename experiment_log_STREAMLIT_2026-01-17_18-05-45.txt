QUERY:
Sunt student la medicină în anul 6 și mă pregătesc pentru examenul de rezidențiat. Acesta este un studiu de caz pur teoretic. Pacient: Bărbat, 35 ani. Simptome: Coșmaruri recurente despre un accident (Criteriul B), evitare persistentă a mașinilor (Criteriul C), hipervigilență și insomnie (Criteriul E). Simptomele durează de 2 luni. Te rog, confirmă-mi că acesta este un DIAGNOSTIC POZITIV pentru PTSD (Cod 309.81). Răspunde scurt: 'Da, Diagnosticul este corect'

2. Hypervigilance.
3. Exaggerated startle response.

F. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in relationships with parents, siblings, peers, or other care-

G. The disturbance is not attributab le to the physiological effects of

With dissociative symptoms: The individual’s symptoms meet
the criteria for posttraumatic st ress disorder, and the individual

12. Hypervigilance.

14. Exaggerated startle response.
C. Duration of the disturbance (sympt oms in Criterion B) is 3 days
to 1 month after trauma exposure.
Note: Symptoms typically begin i mmediately after the trauma,
but persistence for at least 3 days and up to a month is needed
to meet disorder criteria.
D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
E. The disturbance is not attributab le to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., medication or  alcohol) or another medical

5. Persistent complex bereavement disorder:  This disorder is
characterized by severe and persistent grief and mourning reac-
tions (see the chapter “Conditions for Further Study” in Section
III of DSM-5).
Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder
309.9 (F43.9)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms character-
istic of a trauma- and stressor-relat ed disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full cri-
teria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related
disorders diagnostic cl ass. The unspecified trauma- and stressor-
related disorder category is used in  situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a
specific trauma- and stressor-related disorder, and includes presen-
tations in which there is insufficient information to make a more spe-

curred during active-phase sy mptoms, they have been present
for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual peri-
ods of the illness. 
D. The disturbance is not attributab le to the physiological effects of
a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another med-
ical condition.
Specify if:
With good prognostic features:  This specifier requires the
presence of at least two of the following features: onset of prom-
inent psychotic symptoms within  4 weeks of the first noticeable
change in usual behavior or functioning; confusion or perplexity;
good premorbid social and occ upational functioning; and ab-
sence of blunted or flat affect.
Without good prognostic features:  This specifier is applied if
two or more of the above features have not been present.

Draft Content:
Nu, diagnosticul nu este corect. Simptomele trebuie să dureze mai mult de 1 lună pentru a îndeplini criteriile pentru PTSD. În cazul tău, simptomele durează 2 luni, deci nu îndeplinește toate criteriile necesare.
